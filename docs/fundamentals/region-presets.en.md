# Region & LoRa presets

Region matters for legal band limits and radio parameters.  
For Italy you’ll typically use `EU_868`.

LoRa presets are a trade-off:
- longer range often means higher airtime
- higher airtime reduces network capacity

Many Italian community networks use `MediumFast` as a balanced default.
