# Meshtastic Guides (EN)

This site collects **hands-on guides** and best practices for using Meshtastic (apps, firmware, hardware, MQTT, maps).

**Main sources**
- Official documentation: https://meshtastic.org/
- Italian community wiki: https://www.loraitalia.it/

!!! note "Status"
    The primary language is currently **Italian**. English pages are being added gradually.  
    If a page is not translated yet, you’ll see the Italian version (automatic fallback).

## Quick start (10 minutes)

1. Set the **region** (Italy usually uses `EU_868`).
2. Pick a **LoRa modem preset** (many Italian networks use `MediumFast`).
3. Set node name, connect via the app (Bluetooth / Wi‑Fi), send a test message.
4. Share channel settings (name + PSK) if you want others to join.

Start here:
- Fundamentals → Region & LoRa presets
- Fundamentals → Channels & PSK
- Apps → Android / iOS connection
